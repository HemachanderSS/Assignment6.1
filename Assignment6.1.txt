1.Find the top five kinds of GoogleKnowlege_Occupation people who were guests in the
show, in a particular time period.
Take the time period as 1/11/99 to 6/11/99 i.e., 6 months



demo1 = load '/home/kiran/dialy_shows' using PigStorage(',') as (year:chararray,occupation:chararray,date:chararray,group:chararray,gusetlist:chararray);
 
demo2 = foreach demo1 generate occupation,date;
 
demo3 = foreach demo2 generate occupation,ToDate(date,'MM/dd/yy') as date;
 
demo4 = filter demo3 by ((date> ToDate('1/11/99','MM/dd/yy')) AND (date<ToDate('6/11/99','MM/dd/yy')));
 
 
demo5 = group demo4 by occupation;
demo6 = foreach demo5 generate group, COUNT(demo4) as cnt;
 
demo7 = order demo6 by cnt desc;
 
demo8 = limit demo7 5;


2.Find the number of Google Knowledge occupation types in each group, who have been
guests on the show.

demo1 = load 'user/acadgild/pig_data.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (year:chararray,occupation:chararray,date:chararray,group:chararray,gusetlist:chararray);

demo2 = foreach demo1 generate occupation,group;

demo3 = group demo2 by group;

demo4 = foreach demo3 generate group, COUNT(demo2) as cnt;

demo5 = order demo4 by cnt desc;
